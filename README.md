# Expense Tracker

# Project Overview :
The Expense Tracker is a robust and user-friendly database application designed to streamline the process of managing user expenses, categories, and summaries. It allows users to efficiently track daily expenses, view category-wise spending, and generate monthly summaries. This system ensures accurate expense tracking by leveraging SQL queries, PL/SQL procedures, and triggers to automate and enforce data integrity rules.

# Description:
The system is built to provide a comprehensive solution for individuals and organizations to manage multiple aspects of expense tracking. It incorporates features to handle tasks like adding new expenses, categorizing spending, calculating monthly totals, and generating reports.
Using SQL and PL/SQL, the system enables advanced functionalities such as dynamic cost calculations, enforcing data consistency through triggers, and summarizing expenses for efficient budgeting.
The database schema includes key entities such as Users, Expenses, and Categories. Relationships between these entities facilitate efficient data management and retrieval. The system enforces constraints to maintain data integrity and employs stored procedures and triggers for automation.

## Features
- **User Management**:
                    Store and manage user details like name, email, and ID.
                    Allow multiple users to track their expenses separately.
- **Expense Management** :
                       Add, update, and delete expenses with associated details like amount, category, and date.
Track total expenses for each user and category.
- **Category Management**:
                         Maintain a list of predefined and user-defined expense categories.
                         Query total expenses for specific categories.
- **Monthly Summary Reports**:
                             Use PL/SQL procedures to calculate and retrieve monthly spending summaries.
                             Generate reports to help users analyze their financial habits.
- **Data Integrity and Automation**:
                                   Triggers ensure data consistency, such as validating expense entries and maintaining relationships between tables.
                                   Enforce constraints to prevent invalid data entries.
- **Scalability**:
                 The system is designed to handle multiple users and a large number of expense records, making it suitable for both personal and organizational use.
